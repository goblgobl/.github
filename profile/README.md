### Hi.


I'm currently working on a variety of Zig projects:
- [Assets](https://github.com/goblgobl/assets) - static asset proxy server with thumbnail generation
- [Authen](https://github.com/goblgobl/authen) - authentication enhancement system
- [duckdb-proxy](https://github.com/goblgobl/duckdb-proxy) - HTTP proxy for DuckdB.
